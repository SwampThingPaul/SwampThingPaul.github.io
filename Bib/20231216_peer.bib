	abstract = {Spatially variable areas, or hotspots, of elevated mercury (Hg) concentrations in soil, water, and wildlife occur throughout the Everglades wetland ecosystem. This study investigates the stoichiometric controls of Hg relative to soil, water, and biotic components. Surface water, porewater, soil, periphyton, and Gambusia spp. (mosquitofish) were collected from hotspots and non-spot stations and analyzed for various parameters, including total mercury ({THg}), organic carbon ({OC}), total carbon ({TC}), total phosphorus ({TP}), and total nitrogen ({TN}) between late 2010 and early 2013. Soil nutrient ratios were significantly different between hotspot and non-hotspot stations, indicating a difference in trophic status and position along the decay continuum or differences in limiting nutrients. Overall, soil total Hg concentrations were negatively correlated with soil {TC}/{TN}, while soil {TC}/{TP} and soil {TN}/{TP} molar ratios and soil {THg} were negatively correlated at hotspot stations. Meanwhile, mosquitofish {THg} was negatively correlated with soil {TC}/{TN} molar ratio and positively correlated with soil {TC}/{TP} and {TN}/{TP} molar ratios, suggesting trophic truncation. Soil, surface water, and porewater {THg}, {TC}, and {OC} interactions resulted in significant differences between hotspot and non-hotspot stations and between molar ratios of C, N, and P. Periphyton-surface water {THg}/{OC} homeostasis and soil nutrient ratios significantly explained mosquitofish {THg} concentrations, further indicating a trophic influence on mosquitofish {THg} and potential hotspot dynamics. Several factors and processes including bottom-up trophic interaction and vegetation influence on Hg accumulation dynamics and food-chain length explain the development and persistence of Hg hotspot formation within the Everglades system.},

	abstract = {{IntroductionThe} Florida Everglades has undergone significant ecological change spanning the continuum of disturbance to restoration. While the restoration effort is not complete and the ecosystem continues to experience short duration perturbations, a better understanding of long-term C dynamics of the Everglades is needed to facilitate new restoration efforts. This study evaluated temporal trends of different aquatic carbon (C) pools of the northern Everglades Protection Area over a 20-year period to gauge historic C cycling patterns. Dissolved inorganic C ({DIC}), dissolved organic C ({DOC}), particulate organic C ({POC}), and surface water carbon dioxide ({pCO}2(aq)) were investigated between May 1, 1994 and April 30, 2015.{ResultsAnnual} mean concentrations of {DIC}, {DOC}, {POC}, and {pCO}2(aq) significantly decreased through time or remained constant across the Water Conservation Areas ({WCAs}). Overall, the magnitude of the different C pools in the water column significantly differed between regions. Outgassing of {CO}2 was dynamic across the Everglades ranging from 420 to 2001 kg {CO}2 year−1. Overall, the historic trend in {CO}2 flux from the marsh declined across our study area while {pCO}2(aq) largely remained somewhat constant with the exception of Water Conservation Area 2 which experienced significant declines in {pCO}2(aq). Particulate {OC} concentrations were consistent between {WCAs}, but a significantly decreasing trend in annual {POC} concentrations was observed.{ConclusionsHydrologic} condition and nutrient inputs significantly influenced the balance, speciation, and flux of C pools across {WCAs} suggesting a subsidy-stress response in C dynamics relative to landscape scale responses in nutrient availability. The interplay between nutrient inputs and hydrologic condition exert a driving force on the balance between {DIC} and {DOC} production via the metabolism of organic matter which forms the base of the aquatic food web. Along the restoration trajectory as water quality and hydrology continues to improve, it is expected that C pools will respond accordingly.},

	abstract = {{BackgroundEvaluation} of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) ratios in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems can advance our understanding of biological processes, nutrient cycling, and the fate of organic matter ({OM}) in these ecosystems. Eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems can change the accumulation and decomposition of {OM} which can alter biogeochemical cycling and alter the base of the aquatic food web. This study investigated nutrient stoichiometry within and among wetland ecosystem compartments (i.e., water column, flocculent, soil, and aboveground vegetation biomass) of two subtropical treatment wetlands with distinct vegetation communities. Two flow-ways ({FWs}) within the network of Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas in south Florida ({USA}) were selected for this study. We evaluated nutrient stoichiometry of these to understand biogeochemical cycling and controls of nutrient removal in a treatment wetland within an ecological stoichiometry context.{ResultsThis} study demonstrates that C, N, and P stoichiometry can be highly variable among ecosystem compartments and between {FWs}. Power law slopes of C, N, and P within surface water floc, soil, and vegetation were significantly different between and along {FWs}.{ConclusionsAssessment} of wetland nutrient stoichiometry between and within ecosystem compartments suggests unconstrained stoichiometry related to P that conforms with the notion of P limitation in the ecosystem. Differences in N:P ratios between floc and soil suggest different pathways of organic nutrient accumulation and retention between {FWs}. Surface nutrient stoichiometry was highly variable and decoupled (or close to decoupled as indicated by {\textless} 25\% explained variation between parameters), in particular with respect to P. We hypothesize that decoupling may be the imprint of variability in inflow nutrient stoichiometry. However, despite active biogeochemical cycles that could act to restore nutrient stoichiometry along the {FW}, there was little evidence that such balancing occurred, as the degree of stochiometric decoupling in the water column did change with distance downstream. This information is only the beginning of a larger journey to understand stoichiometric processes within wetland ecosystems and how they relate to ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication of coastal ecosystems and decline of essential benthic ecosystems are growing concerns globally. Understanding the drivers associated with a response of an indicator species at an ecosystem or even regional-scale hinges on a robust evaluation of data that spans both space and time. Consistent data, suitable and methodical data-handling procedures, appropriate statistical evaluation and logical assessment of hypotheses are essential. Lapointe et al. (Mar Biol 166:108, 2019) suggest that decline of stony coral at Looe Key reef is attributed to local and regional (i.e., discharge {\textgreater} 200 km away) nutrient discharges causing eutrophication of coastal waters and the degradation of essential habitat. Furthermore, Lapointe et al. (Mar Biol 166:108, 2019) posit that the restored freshwater flows to the Everglades ecosystem is a causative agent for the observed coral decline observed at Looe Key Reef. While the decline in coral coverage is alarming, rigorous statistical analysis is needed to attribute a true cause-and-effect relationship. This commentary discusses data handling techniques, the application of statistical methods, interoperability of data and evaluation of hypotheses presented by Lapointe et al. (Mar Biol 166:108, 2019) specific to Looe Key reef within the Florida Key Marine Sanctuary. This commentary is not merely a critique of the statistics used by the authors but rather the inappropriate statistical methods utilized and how it affects the acceptance or rejection of the authors’ hypotheses and the overall conclusions drawn.},

During Hurricane Irma\&rsquo;s passage through northern Florida, water movements driven by wind velocities up to 105 km h\&minus;1 caused a salinity peak in an estuary/blackwater river complex. Water quality was monitored across the 15 km site to detect the magnitude and duration of disturbance. Saline water intruded 15 km inland into a freshwater portion of the river that peaked at a salinity of 2 psu. Due to the volume of precipitation from the hurricane, significant runoff of freshwater and dissolved organic matter ({DOM}) caused a decrease in salinity, dissolved oxygen ({DO}), and Chlorophyll-a concentrations while increasing turbidity and fluorescent dissolved organic matter ({fDOM}). The disturbance caused rapid changes observed by in-situ water quality monitors over a 3-week period, but some effects persisted for longer periods as shown by 3-month weekly water sampling. This disturbance caused shifts in {DOM} loading, altered salinity dynamics, and reshaped landscapes due to wind and wave surge both in upland marsh and downstream estuary. Hurricane disturbance temporarily and abruptly alters the aquatic continuum, and observations of system response can help us understand the mechanisms associated with ecosystem resilience and recovery.},

Plant nutrient sequestration in wetland ecosystems is a key process for downstream water quality. However, few studies have examined stoichiometric homeostasis of aquatic vegetation despite the importance of stoichiometry to plant nutrient uptake efficiency. This study investigated stoichiometric homeostasis of dominant emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation ({EAV} and {SAV}, respectively) within two treatment flow-ways of Everglades Stormwater Treatment Area 2 ({STA}-2). These flow-ways encompass a large gradient in plant nutrient availability. This study hypothesizes that wetland vegetation is homeostatic relative to ambient nutrients and consequently nutrient resorption does not vary along the nutrient gradient. We developed a framework to investigate how vegetation uptake and resorption of nutrients contribute separately to homeostasis. Overall, we determined that the wetland vegetation in this study was non-homeostatic with respect to differential uptake of nitrogen (N) versus phosphorus (P). In {EAV}, P resorption was relatively high and N resorption was moderate, and resorption efficiency did not vary significantly along the gradient. In separating the proportional contribution of resorption and uptake to the degree of homeostasis, resorption did not affect overall homeostatic status in {EAV}.},

Aquatic ecosystem metabolism can be characterized by the diel change in {DO} changes over time and is expressed as the net aquatic productivity ({NAP}) based on the balance of gross primary productivity ({GPP}) and ecosystem respiration ({ER}). This study investigated aquatic metabolism of dominant emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation ({EAV} and {SAV}, respectively) within two treatment flow-ways of Stormwater Treatment Area 2 ({STA}-2) in the Everglades ecosystem. This study hypothesizes that aquatic metabolism will differ between aquatic vegetation communities with {SAV} communities having a greater {GPP} and {ER} rate than {EAV} communities driven by biophysical, hydrodynamic, and biogeochemical differences between systems. Aquatic metabolism observed in this study varied spatially (along flow-ways) and temporally (diel to days) controlled by different factors related to biological, physical, and chemical processes. This study suggests that ecosystem metabolism is controlled differently across flow-ways with varying levels of response to loading/transport and water quality resulting in differences in organic matter accumulation, C turnover, and P cycling. The relationship between {GPP} and {TP} concentrations could be an indicator of P-removal efficiency and ecosystem function.},

However, human modification of rivers and floodplains through channelization, artificial levee construction, reductions in the active floodplain area, and water management can significantly reduce the ecosystem function of river–floodplain systems. In this study, we evaluated the changes in the nutrient loading of the Kissimmee River floodplain during the restoration of the river–floodplain system. In addition to time-series loading analysis, we also evaluated soil nutrient concentrations across the lower portion of the Kissimmee River floodplain. During the 44-year nutrient loading time-series, the floodplain remained a nutrient exporter with changes in nutrient loading generally corresponding to both water quality (i.e., point source reductions) and hydrologic restoration activities in the watershed and Kissimmee River floodplain. During the study period, inputs of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads from upstream either significantly increased or remained the same. In addition to external sources of nutrients, internal sources of nutrients from floodplain soils can also contribute to the total nutrient export from the system. These internal sources could be organic via the decomposition of organic matter or geologic from the original excavation of the canal and/or restoration backfilling. Soil nutrient concentrations vary between vegetative communities and landscape position and could be a significant source of phosphorus to the downstream system, which is plagued by eutrophic conditions. Therefore, as floodplain function in the Kissimmee River continues to be restored and managed, additional effort may be needed to address nutrient inputs and internal legacy nutrients.},

	abstract = {The Everglades Stormwater Treatment Areas ({STAs}) in South Florida are large treatment wetlands that were constructed and managed to reduce phosphorus (P) loads to the Everglades Protection Area. Most P in inflow waters originates from urban, agricultural, and equestrian runoff, as well as discharges from Lake Okeechobee. To effectively reduce dissolved organic P ({DOP}) in the outflow of the {STAs}, {DOP} must be mineralized to soluble reactive phosphorus ({SRP}) (Ged and Boyer, 2013), and then removed through uptake by aquatic vegetation or co-precipitation with calcite during photosynthesis. In order to explore the effects of sunlight and photolytic processing on dissolved P mineralization within the {STAs}, a series of photochemical experiments were conducted. First, {DOM} entering the {STAs} was measured and found to be highly aromatic (mean {SUVA} = 0.38) and dominated by large molecular weight molecules (75\% of bulk {DOM} {\textgreater} 10KDa) that are reactive to photolytic degradation. Model molecules, such as phytic acid, and site water from the {STAs} were exposed to light and produced {SRP} from {DOP} after exposure to high energy {UV} radiation. Additionally, analysis of excitation emission matrices ({EEM}) found that aromatic and humic structures were photolytically degraded during {UV} exposure. These findings suggest that photolysis is a significant process in {DOM} and P cycling in the {STAs}, and if leveraged in {SAV} dominated areas, could benefit P removal by co-precipitation with calcite. These findings suggest that vegetation management strategies could be employed to maximize {UV} photolytic reactions to optimize P retention.},

	abstract = {Riverine exports of silicon (Si) influence global carbon cycling through the growth of marine diatoms, which account for ∼25\% of global primary production. Climate change will likely alter river Si exports in biome-specific ways due to interacting shifts in chemical weathering rates, hydrologic connectivity, and metabolic processes in aquatic and terrestrial systems. Nonetheless, factors driving long-term changes in Si exports remain unexplored at local, regional, and global scales. We evaluated how concentrations and yields of dissolved Si ({DSi}) changed over the last several decades of rapid climate warming using long-term data sets from 60 rivers and streams spanning the globe (e.g., Antarctic, tropical, temperate, boreal, alpine, Arctic systems). We show that widespread changes in river {DSi} concentration and yield have occurred, with the most substantial shifts occurring in alpine and polar regions. The magnitude and direction of trends varied within and among biomes, were most strongly associated with differences in land cover, and were often independent of changes in river discharge. These findings indicate that there are likely diverse mechanisms driving change in river Si biogeochemistry that span the land-water interface, which may include glacial melt, changes in terrestrial vegetation, and river productivity. Finally, trends were often stronger in months outside of the growing season, particularly in temperate and boreal systems, demonstrating a potentially important role of shifting seasonality for the flux of Si from rivers. Our results have implications for the timing and magnitude of silica processing in rivers and its delivery to global oceans.},

Numerous regions have implemented beneficial management practices to combat agricultural nonpoint pollution, often evaluating efficacy at the field scale, but not downstream.

The monitoring took place before and after the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures in the catchment, allowing assessment of changes over time in the downstream tributary and lake. We analyzed long-term trends and temporal change points for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, aquatic trophic status, and nutrient stoichiometric ratios. The results revealed significant reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, improved lake trophic status from hypereutrophic to eutrophic, and an increase in total nitrogen: total phosphorus ratios following the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures. Notably, both the lake and its main tributary exhibited significant temporal change points for these parameters. Our findings offer evidence of a relatively rapid, positive effect of the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures contributing to subsequent improvements in downstream water quality.},

	abstract = {Seagrass communities are vitally important ecosystems that support and foster organisms across trophic levels. Understanding the drivers of seagrass distribution and extent in estuary systems is valuable for conservation and restoration efforts. A critical driver of seagrass distribution is how light moves through the water column (i.e. light attenuation) and the availability of light to reach the estuary bottom. Light attenuation combined with the depth of seagrass colonization is used to estimate the percent surface irradiance and is an indicator of seagrass light requirements The objective of this study was to evaluate optical water quality parameters within the Caloosahatchee River Estuary ({CRE}) relative to changes in freshwater discharge conditions. During the study period, freshwater discharge significantly increased resulting in an increase of annual stressful and damaging discharge events to marine seagrass species. Concurrent with changes in freshwater discharge conditions, changes to optical water quality parameters including color, chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and light attenuation were detected along the estuary. Using photo-interpreted seagrass coverage data combined with bathymetric data, the depth of colonization was estimated for three survey years (2008, 2014, and 2020). This information combined with a spatial and temporal light attenuation generalized additive model percent surface irradiance (\%{SI}) was estimated. Over the study period, \%{SI} significantly increased across the lower {CRE} indicating an improvement in light attenuation. The current freshwater management plan has increased stressful and damaging discharge events, however recent changes in operations has minimized these damaging events which could be linked to the precipitous increase in \%{SI} across the lower {CRE}. Seagrass density data collected from transects within the estuary suggest that prolonged stress and damaging ({\textgreater}5.13 hm3d−1) has significantly reduce species density. Future water management strategies are expected to reduce the frequency and volume of discharges to the {CRE}, effectively reducing stress and damaging freshwater discharge event.},

	abstract = {The southern tip of North America coalesces into one of the world’s largest freshwater wetlands, the Everglades, Florida, {USA}. Though this region is much like an island, home to high biodiversity and endemism, it is also the site of a century of development and associated landscape-scale species invasions. Melaleuca quinquenervia (hereafter melaleuca), a tree native to tropical Australia, was planted extensively throughout south Florida as street trees, levee stabilizers, and later to reduce standing water in marshy areas. Through extensive cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture’s Australian Biological Control Laboratory, several biological control agents were released, three of which later successfully established. Herein we examine evidence that plant community shifts determined from vegetation surveys and remotely sensed images reflect changes from melaleuca-dominated wetlands (before management) to native communities (after management). Melaleuca-dominated community types decreased from 1990 to 2020 by more than 99\%. Vegetation surveys also reflect an increase in cypress wetlands, pinelands, and open water wetlands, all of which were dominated by melaleuca in previous decades. We also found the normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) increased in melaleuca-invaded wetlands during peak infestations but decreased again after communities recovered to sawgrass-dominated wetlands. These responses are concomitant with the development of integrative management techniques for melaleuca that include mechanical, chemical, and biological control. Our results confirm previous findings that biological control likely augments conventional management methods by limiting recovery of invasive species.},
