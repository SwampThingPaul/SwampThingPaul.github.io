    "text": "1Adapted from the Saltmarsh Habitat & Avian Research Program (https://www.tidalmarshbirds.org/) Guidelines for Authorship Standard Operating Procedure.\n\nDeciding authorship on scientific publications can be complicated because practices and cultural norms vary across disciplines and even across labs within the same discipline. This is especially relevant in ecology, where standardized guidelines are lacking and a diversity of options exist for deciding authorship and author order. These guidelines outline a set of criteria for authorship determinations. These criteria are presented as guidelines, because a common set of expectations is important to maintain mutual satisfaction among co- authors. We recognize, however, that some flexibility will be required and communication is essential to the process. Before all else, remember conversations regarding authorship for each manuscript should happen early, frequently, openly, and inclusively. A conversation should be expected when the paper is first conceived and should be revisited periodically as each project develops.\n\n\nAuthorship on a manuscript is warranted when a researcher has made a substantial contribution to the manuscript in question (not the overall project as a whole), as defined by any two of the following:\n\nConceiving of ideas and/or study design and/or analytical approach\nWriting of the manuscript (or sections)\nReviewing and editing the manuscript\nAnalyzing data\nInterpreting results\nCollecting data in field or lab (except in rare circumstances this will not include temporary technicians)\nCreating or managing critical databases (e.g. demographic database, historical abundance estimates spreadsheet)\nObtaining funding (e.g., proposal writing, grant management, and project reports)\n\nOther things are important to keep in mind (expanded upon in the sections below).\n\nA conversation is necessary for each manuscript\nConsider thresholds of effort (“could the study have been done without the contribution?”)\nOffer further involvement\nUse inclusion to deal with uncertainty (“better to be inclusive than to exclude”)\nPrimary authors and their advisors/PIs/mentors will make the final decision on authorship\nInvite prior individuals (alumni) to participate when appropriate\nThere are exceptions for grant deliverables.\nWhen in doubt, talk it out!\n\nConsider Thresholds of Effort\nUltimately, the primary author must have some leeway in making authorship decisions, and ensuring that a certain minimum threshold of contribution has been made. When the level of the contribution to the particular manuscript is unclear (e.g. as in the case of data collection), the deciding question becomes “could the study have been done without that person’s contribution?”\nFor instance, did the extra work amount to a few data points within a huge dataset (if the analysis was enhanced by their participation, but was possible without it, authorship may not be warranted), or were the data points critical to establishing the pattern (if the analysis is impossible without the data from this study site, or if trends depend on those data, authorship is more clearly warranted). Other considerations: If a researcher is collecting data for a study that is not their own, did they do extra work that they would not otherwise have done on their own study site or for their own study (if so, the case for authorship increases)? Did the effort amount to a few days of fieldwork (may not warrant authorship) or a season’s worth of logistics and data collection (more clearly warrants authorship)?\nOffer Further Involvement\nIn some instances, a contributor may have clearly passed a threshold of effort (see previous), but will have only contributed to one of the categories that would qualify them for consideration of authorship. In these instances, it is the primary author’s responsibility to reach out to the contributor early in the writing process and have a conversation about further involvement. The second category can be easily achieved by assistance with developing and reviewing the manuscript, and contributors that have clearly passed a threshold of effort should be given that opportunity.\nUse Inclusion to Deal with Uncertainty\nRecognize that the contribution of effort is a gradient with clear endpoints (one data point out of two probably gets you authorship, one data point out of 1,000 probably doesn’t), so there will likely be situations where it is unclear (200 data points out of 1,000?). If there is any uncertainty in gauging the contribution, it is better to be inclusive than to exclude, and it is better to talk directly to the contributor explicitly. A quick phone call made in a spirit of inclusion can almost always improve the situation for everyone, both for this manuscript and for future collaboration.\nInvite Alumni to Participate when Appropriate\nAs data collected by others who have moved on are used in analysis, we need to give them credit for their prior work. If the data have already been published in another form and their papers can be cited, this may be enough. Authorship may be warranted or offered, however, under several circumstances. First, if the individual was involved in the conception of the ideas in the new manuscript, this would warrant their inclusion. Second, if the new manuscript is based largely on the data (or conceptual groundwork) of a single individual (similar to the rules for contemporary contributors, could the analysis be completed without their data?), authorship should be considered. If the previous work of prior individuals passes the Threshold of Effort test for any reason, the burden is on the PI involved to offer the opportunity for further engagement in the new manuscript to new individuals, preferably early in the process. If prior individuals respond positively and stay involved, then they should be authors on the new work. Prior individuals are responsible for deciding to stay engaged and following through with their involvement. Importantly, prior individuals should understand that if they do not respond to inquiries about authorship, historical datasets can still be used, but they will not be included as authors. This same approach may be followed for the advisors of prior individuals if they pass the Threshold.\n\n\n\nThe order of authors on publications will follow the practice of first-last author emphasis. The first author will be the person who did the majority of the work, carried out the study, and will often be a the primary writer of the manuscript. Typically, the last author should be the lab PI. “Credit” or “importance” is attributed to authors in the following order: first, last, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. Final decisions regarding author order ultimately lie with the first author, in consultation with their advisor, PI or mentor. Authors that disagree with the draft author order, however, should feel comfortable voicing their concerns. More importantly, primary authors should ask specifically for co-authors to approve the final order via email.\nAnyone listed as an author must be given a fair opportunity to read and comment on the manuscript. If prospective authors do not respond in a reasonable amount of time, they should be removed, barring exceptional circumstances (the response could be as simple as “manuscript is good to go”, as long as the author acknowledges and approves the content). The lead author should give AT LEAST two weeks for the response period and should specify a date by which comments are due. Two corollaries of this guideline are 1) anyone has the right to request removal as author from a paper for any reason, including a personal judgment of failure to cross the Threshold for Effort, and 2) no one should ever be an author on a manuscript where they did not approve the final submitted draft (note that many journals have this requirement).\nIt is the primary author’s responsibility, as corresponding author, to provide all co-authors with:\n\nA digital version of the final submitted draft\nNews of all significant correspondence with the editor/publisher\nThe opportunity to assist with revisions\nA digital version of all revisions submitted for publication and the responses to reviewers\nPage proofs and the opportunity to comment on them\nA final pdf of all published papers\n\n\n\n\nExpectations for authorship are a set of evolving cultural norms. This means that 1) they must be taught anew to each set of students and/or new individual early in their involvement with the project and 2) the guidelines in this document need to be revisited and updated regularly (~annually or as needed).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dissemination of research to the broader scientific community is not only part of the research process, but perhaps the ultimate reason for conducting research in the first place. There is an expectation and responsibility to share one’s work with the broader community (Cooke et al. 2014). It goes without saying that composing a manuscript by committee can be difficult. Co-authorship comes about in a variety of ways some of which may not require a formal role in writing but rather the collection of data, editing of the manuscript, etc. Some manuscripts are planned in advanced and have the luxury of identfying the core author pool. Other manuscripts are produced ad-hoc. Regardless of the origin it is recommended that if the manuscript has more than two authors it is advisable that a lead author along with a supporting person (typically senior author assumes this role) be identified. The objective of having two (or more) authors is to have these individuals generate a paper that is as close to final as possible, after all two-eyes are better than one. Letting other co-authors know that the paper is ready to move forward in the eyes of both the lead senior authors will often help to elicit a rapid review and response by co-authors.\nEveryone is busy, therefore some degree of time-management is needed when composing an manuscript. Therefore it is recommended that tentative deadlines/time-periods are discussed early and often. If necessary these deadline can be revised as needed due to changing priorities within reason but make sure these changes are communicated amongst all authors. Once a draft manuscript is produced and ready for co-author input provide a reasonable review deadline (couple of weeks). Typically, if co-authors are unresponsive its not they don’t find the manuscript important. It is possible that it has been shuffled down the dreaded “to do” list or they just forgot. This has happened to all of us at some point. Therefore a simple reminder would be helpful to re-engage the co-authors. Below is a flow chart from Cooke et al. (2014) with a suggested example of sequence of events to work with tardy or non-responsive co-authors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow-diagram with a possile sequence of events for working with tardy or non-responsive co-authors when preparing a manuscript for submission to a journal. From Cooke et al. (2014).\n\n\n\n\nAs suggested above, if co-authors are completely unresponsive it is the lead authors progrative, with input from co-authors to remove unresponsive co-authors. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), has additional guidance information regarding authorship and ethics.\n\n\n\n\nJournals are increasingly requiring authors to specify roles according to author contributions. The days of honorary authorship is slowly (too slowly) coming to an end. However, there are many other aspects of research that are not adequately captured by the generally recognized short list of contributing roles, particularly in applied environmental disciplines such as conservation science, environmental science and applied ecology (herein referred to as conservation science). Cooke et al. (2021) provides some additional context and consideration to authorship guidelines reviewing existing and proposing potential expanded contributors roles.\nBottom line\nPoints summarized from the abstract of Cook et al. (2021).\n\nAuthorship should acknowledge and reward those deserving of credit. Being an author on a paper also means that one assumes some degree of ownership of the content, regardless of the authorship order. (Something, it feels, has been forgotten recently)\nThe growing recognition that authorship should reflect contributions that extend beyond the usual data collection, analysis and writing provides the ideal backdrop for rethinking contributions in conservation science. Cook et al. (2021) propose a more inclusive approach to authorship that recognizes and values diverse contributions and contributors using an expanded list of defined roles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooke SJ, Donaldson MR, Clark TD (2014) Practical guidance for early career researchers dealing with tardy or unresponsive co-authors.

Two corollaries of this guideline are 1) anyone has the right to request removal as author from a paper for any reason, including a personal judgment of failure to cross the Threshold for Effort, and 2) no one should ever be an author on a manuscript where they did not approve the final submitted draft (note that many journals have this requirement).\nIt is the primary author’s responsibility, as corresponding author, to provide all co-authors with:\n\nA digital version of the final submitted draft\nNews of all significant correspondence with the editor/publisher\nThe opportunity to assist with revisions\nA digital version of all revisions submitted for publication and the responses to reviewers\nPage proofs and the opportunity to comment on them\nA final pdf of all published papers"

    "text": "The dissemination of research to the broader scientific community is not only part of the research process, but perhaps the ultimate reason for conducting research in the first place. There is an expectation and responsibility to share one’s work with the broader community (Cooke et al. 2014). It goes without saying that composing a manuscript by committee can be difficult. Co-authorship comes about in a variety of ways some of which may not require a formal role in writing but rather the collection of data, editing of the manuscript, etc. Some manuscripts are planned in advanced and have the luxury of identfying the core author pool. Other manuscripts are produced ad-hoc. Regardless of the origin it is recommended that if the manuscript has more than two authors it is advisable that a lead author along with a supporting person (typically senior author assumes this role) be identified. The objective of having two (or more) authors is to have these individuals generate a paper that is as close to final as possible, after all two-eyes are better than one. Letting other co-authors know that the paper is ready to move forward in the eyes of both the lead senior authors will often help to elicit a rapid review and response by co-authors.\nEveryone is busy, therefore some degree of time-management is needed when composing an manuscript. Therefore it is recommended that tentative deadlines/time-periods are discussed early and often. If necessary these deadline can be revised as needed due to changing priorities within reason but make sure these changes are communicated amongst all authors. Once a draft manuscript is produced and ready for co-author input provide a reasonable review deadline (couple of weeks). Typically, if co-authors are unresponsive its not they don’t find the manuscript important. It is possible that it has been shuffled down the dreaded “to do” list or they just forgot. This has happened to all of us at some point. Therefore a simple reminder would be helpful to re-engage the co-authors. Below is a flow chart from Cooke et al. (2014) with a suggested example of sequence of events to work with tardy or non-responsive co-authors.\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow-diagram with a possile sequence of events for working with tardy or non-responsive co-authors when preparing a manuscript for submission to a journal. From Cooke et al. (2014).\n\n\n\n\nAs suggested above, if co-authors are completely unresponsive it is the lead authors progrative, with input from co-authors to remove unresponsive co-authors. The Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), has additional guidance information regarding authorship and ethics."

    "text": "Journals are increasingly requiring authors to specify roles according to author contributions. The days of honorary authorship is slowly (too slowly) coming to an end. However, there are many other aspects of research that are not adequately captured by the generally recognized short list of contributing roles, particularly in applied environmental disciplines such as conservation science, environmental science and applied ecology (herein referred to as conservation science). Cooke et al. (2021) provides some additional context and consideration to authorship guidelines reviewing existing and proposing potential expanded contributors roles.\nBottom line\nPoints summarized from the abstract of Cook et al. (2021).\n\nAuthorship should acknowledge and reward those deserving of credit. Being an author on a paper also means that one assumes some degree of ownership of the content, regardless of the authorship order. (Something, it feels, has been forgotten recently)\nThe growing recognition that authorship should reflect contributions that extend beyond the usual data collection, analysis and writing provides the ideal backdrop for rethinking contributions in conservation science. Cook et al. (2021) propose a more inclusive approach to authorship that recognizes and values diverse contributions and contributors using an expanded list of defined roles."

If you look in the dictionary it will say something along the lines of a series if values/measurements/observations obtained at successive times, often (but not always) with equal intervals between them. Simply put its data collected over time. In my corner of science that could mean daily water levels, weekly total phosphorus concentrations, annual seagrass coverage, etc. Once collected these data can analyzed in a variety of ways depending on the motivation of why and where its being collected. Again, in my realm of the science, something we are interested in is the change in conditions overtime for a variety of reasons including (but not limited to) climate change, landscape scale changes (i.e. land-use alterations, dam removal, stream diversion, etc.), restoration activities, forecast modeling, etc. In this case, a time series analysis is needed to see how things are changing overtime."

    "text": "Formatting\nWhen handling time series data in R you can either handle the data as a data.frame (or tibble if you are a tidyverse person … I personally am not, no judgement) or a ts object.\nGenerate some example value\n\nset.seed(123)\nvalues &lt;- runif(5)|&gt;\n  round(2)\n\n\n\n\ndata.frame\n\n\nts\n\n\n\n\ndata.frame(Yr = 2012:2016, \n           value = values\n           )\n\n    Yr value\n1 2012  0.29\n2 2013  0.79\n3 2014  0.41\n4 2015  0.88\n5 2016  0.94\n\n\n\nts(values, start = 2012)\n\nTime Series:\nStart = 2012 \nEnd = 2016 \nFrequency = 1 \n[1] 0.29 0.79 0.41 0.88 0.94\n\n\n\n\nThere are pros and cons of formatting the data either way. Most time series analysis functions can handle both in someway but most like it to be a ts object. The way the ts function works is it essentially converts the data into a special data matrix and added a header with some information. Depending on the information you include in the ts function it makes some assumptions, for instance with frequency = 12 it assumes its monthly data or frequency = 365 assumes daily.\n\nrnorm(24)|&gt;\n  round(2)|&gt;\n  ts(frequency = 12)\n\n    Jan   Feb   Mar   Apr   May   Jun   Jul   Aug   Sep   Oct   Nov   Dec\n1 -1.69  1.24 -0.11 -0.12  0.18  1.28 -1.73  1.69  0.50  2.53  0.55  0.24\n2 -1.05  1.29  0.83 -0.06 -0.78 -0.73 -0.22 -0.33 -1.09 -0.09  1.07 -0.15\n\n\nSee ?ts for more details on specifics. A very big drawback when using ts is if you are working with daily data with a leap year or years with leap years mixed in ts doesn’t know how to handle that extra day since the input is a vector or string of data. There might be a way to coerce it but I’ve yet to figure it out. Which is why I prefer to work in the data.frame world whenever possible."

My preference (again not tidyverse) is functionality in the plyr package.\n\nlibrary(plyr)\nddply(dat1$timeseries,c(\"Yr\"),summarise,\n      mean.val = mean(value),\n      sd.val = sd(value),\n      var.val = var(value),\n      N.val = length(value), #or AnalystHelper::N.obs(value)\n      SE = AnalystHelper::SE(value),\n      med.val = median(value),\n      min.val = min(value),\n      max.val = max(value))|&gt;\n  round(2)# added to consolidate the table down\n\n     Yr mean.val sd.val var.val N.val   SE med.val min.val max.val\n1  1990     3.26   1.63    2.66    12 0.47    3.61    0.84    5.85\n2  1991     3.36   1.67    2.80    12 0.48    3.03    0.99    6.03\n3  1992     3.85   1.28    1.63    12 0.37    4.20    1.92    6.09\n4  1993     4.02   1.36    1.85    12 0.39    3.96    1.86    5.82\n5  1994     4.48   1.48    2.19    12 0.43    4.82    1.65    6.40\n6  1995     4.60   1.20    1.43    12 0.35    4.42    2.99    6.41\n7  1996     4.96   1.44    2.08    12 0.42    4.88    3.03    7.14\n8  1997     5.44   1.46    2.13    12 0.42    5.46    3.30    7.72\n9  1998     5.48   1.65    2.71    12 0.48    5.27    3.15    7.95\n10 1999     5.75   1.46    2.12    12 0.42    5.66    3.90    7.94\n11 2000     6.20   1.46    2.12    12 0.42    6.26    3.74    8.05\n12 2001     6.29   1.45    2.10    12 0.42    6.56    4.05    8.70\n13 2002     6.70   1.43    2.04    12 0.41    6.46    4.61    8.78\n14 2003     7.18   1.46    2.13    12 0.42    6.97    4.92    9.46\n15 2004     7.42   1.53    2.35    12 0.44    7.79    5.12    9.17\n\n\nOnce the data is aggregated we can use the simple Kendall test to look at the overall annual trend in the data.\n\ncor.test(dat1_yr$Yr,dat1_yr$value,method = \"kendall\")\n\n\n    Kendall's rank correlation tau\n\ndata:  dat1_yr$Yr and dat1_yr$value\nT = 105, p-value = 1.529e-12\nalternative hypothesis: true tau is not equal to 0\nsample estimates:\ntau \n  1 \n\n\nLooks like a perfect increasing trend! The Kendall 𝜏 is a type of correlation coefficient so the values should range between -1 and 1. Based on the 𝜌-value, (assuming an 𝛼-value of 0.05) this is a statistically significant trend. (Lets not get into the 𝜌-value discussion!)\nWe can also look at the rate of change. The most common is the Theil-Sen slope estimator. There are several different packages out there that can estimate Theil-Sen slope but the most basic one that I’ve come across is the median based linear model or mblm package. We can discuss the basics of Theil-Sen and mblm in a later post but after some digging and search what I’ve determined is that Theil-Sen method and median-based linear model are closely related. Generally, the Theil-Sen method is a non-parametric method that calculates the median of slopes of all lines through the data and the intercept is often the median of the residuals after fitting the slope. Meanwhile, the median-based linear model is a regression model that uses medians as a criterion for fitting a model and minimizes the sum of absolute residuals. In most cases, the Theil-Sen slope and the slope determined by the median-based linear model are the same with minuscule differences. Most trend routines use median-based linear models or quantile regressions as a basis to perform Theil-Sen estimation.\nIf you run the side-by-side of mblm, zyp and a separate Theil-Sen estimator pulled from the litature (found here) you’ll undoubtly come to similar, if not the same values. Don’t believe me lets give it a try.\n\nlibrary(zyp)\nlibrary(mblm)\n\n# From University of Virigina function (from literature)\ntheil_sen &lt;- function(x,y){\n  n &lt;- length(x)\n  max_n_slopes &lt;- (n * (n - 1)) / 2\n  slopes &lt;- vector(mode = 'list', length = max_n_slopes) # list of NULL elements\n  add_at &lt;- 1\n  # Calculate point-to-point slopes if x_i != x_j\n  for (i in 1:(n - 1)) {\n    slopes_i &lt;- lapply((i + 1):n, function(j) \n      if (x[j] != x[i]) { (y[j] - y[i]) / (x[j] - x[i]) })\n    slopes[add_at:(add_at + length(slopes_i) - 1)] &lt;- slopes_i\n    add_at &lt;- add_at + length(slopes_i)\n  }\n  # Calculate Theil-Sen slope\n  slopes &lt;- unlist(slopes) # drop NULL elements\n  theil_sen_slope &lt;- median(slopes, na.rm = TRUE)\n  # Calculate Theil-Sen intercept\n  intercepts &lt;- y - (theil_sen_slope * x)\n  theil_sen_intercept &lt;- median(intercepts, na.rm = TRUE)\n  # Return\n  c('Theil-Sen intercept' = theil_sen_intercept, \n    'Theil-Sen slope' = theil_sen_slope)\n}\n\n\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Generate linear data\nx &lt;- 1:100\ny &lt;- 2*x + rnorm(100, 0, 10)\n# Add some outliers\ny[c(10, 30, 50, 70, 90)] &lt;- y[c(10, 30, 50, 70, 90)] + 50\n\nplot(y~x,las=1)\n\n\n\nzyp.sen &lt;-  zyp.sen(y~x); # zyp package\nmblm.sen &lt;-  mblm(y~x,repeated = F); # mblm package\nUV.sen &lt;-  theil_sen(x,y); # University of Virigina function (from literature)\n\n\n\n  Pack intercept   Slope\n1  zyp   0.40106 2.01976\n2 mblm   0.40106 2.01976\n3   UV   0.40106 2.01976\n\n\nThere you have it, all three methods produce the same estimates.\nBack to our aggregated dataset, the code is pretty straight forward but there are a couple of things to be aware. Currently, the mblm function can’t handle datasets with NAs, so you might have to clean up the data a little (i.e. na.omit() can be your friend). Also double check that both variables are numeric.\n\nlibrary(mblm)\n\ndat1.theilsen &lt;- mblm(value~Yr,dat1_yr,repeated=F)\n\ndat1.theilsen\n\n\nCall:\nmblm(formula = value ~ Yr, dataframe = dat1_yr, repeated = F)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)           Yr  \n  -587.9833       0.2971  \n\n# extrapolate example\npredict(dat1.theilsen,data.frame(Yr=2005:2014),interval =\"confidence\")\n\n         fit       lwr       upr\n1   7.629230  7.500516  7.757944\n2   7.926294  7.784963  8.067624\n3   8.223357  8.069143  8.377572\n4   8.520421  8.353116  8.687725\n5   8.817484  8.636929  8.998040\n6   9.114548  8.920614  9.308482\n7   9.411611  9.204195  9.619028\n8   9.708675  9.487692  9.929658\n9  10.005739  9.771119 10.240358\n10 10.302802 10.054488 10.551116\n\n\nThe Theil-Sen estimator for the annually aggregated data is 0.297 units per year. This is the rate of annual change. If this was something like sea-level rise, rainfall rate, population growth, etc. you can do a very basic analysis and ask at this rate what would the values be in 10 years (extrapolating … 10.3 units) or in the case of sea-level rise whats the rise per decade (2.97 units per decade)?"
