My research can be boardly categorized as aquatic biogeochemistry. I am interesting in the physical, biological, geological and chemical processes that govern the composition and function of aquatic ecosystems. While most of my research is wetland centric I am also interested in how biogeochemical processes in lake, river and estuarine ecosystems.

Aquatic ecoystems hold a significant ecological and anthropogenic value. As such human activies (*directly* and *indirectly*) have the potential to significantly alter or degrade these ecosystems. My research is partly shaped by understanding these anthropogenic pressures (i.e. eutrophication, sea-level rise, etc.) in an ecological context and how it influences the ecosystems biogeochemical cycles. Rooted in foundational ecological theory I continue to revist these cornerstone theories and apply them to new ecosystems in novel ways.

### Mission Statement



### Vision Statement

from statement of research interest...need to edit. 
In the future, I intend to continue develop my research program to address issues such as the impacts of altered rainfall and temperature patterns on ecosystem productivity, the effects of sea-level rise on ecosystem distribution and extent, basal food-web dynamics of ecosystem experiencing long-term restoration. Both my current and future research are multi-disciplinary efforts developed to investigate ecosystem level ecology in an ever-changing landscape.
