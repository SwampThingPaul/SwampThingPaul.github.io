Nutrient stoichiometry is the consequences of mass balance of chemical elements constrained by biology and ecology. The most notable nutrient stoichiometric ratio cited is the “Redfield ratio”. This ratio relates carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) between plankton biomass and seawater with a C:N:P ratio of 106:16:1. Several studies have attempted to study “Redfield-like” ratios for terrestrial ecosystems, most focusing on plant biomass nutrients, plant litter, microbes and consumers.

A tenant of ecological stoichiometry is that the abundance of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or other elements is regulated by reciprocal interaction between organisms and their environment. This reciprocation of organism and environmental nutrients is the central theme of stoichiometric homeostasis. Stoichiometric homeostasis was originally developed in the context of ecosystem disturbances and perturbations to assess whether organisms and ecosystems respond to changing conditions and of particular interest with respect to nutrient enrichment processes since nutrient homeostatic regulation has the potential to decouple nutrient transport by selective or variable uptake.
