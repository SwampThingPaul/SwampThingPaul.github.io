This study investigates the stoichiometric controls of Hg relative to soil, water, and biotic components. Surface water, porewater, soil, periphyton, and Gambusia spp. (mosquitofish) were collected from hotspots and non-spot stations and analyzed for various parameters, including total mercury ({THg}), organic carbon ({OC}), total carbon ({TC}), total phosphorus ({TP}), and total nitrogen ({TN}) between late 2010 and early 2013. Soil nutrient ratios were significantly different between hotspot and non-hotspot stations, indicating a difference in trophic status and position along the decay continuum or differences in limiting nutrients. Overall, soil total Hg concentrations were negatively correlated with soil {TC}/{TN}, while soil {TC}/{TP} and soil {TN}/{TP} molar ratios and soil {THg} were negatively correlated at hotspot stations. Meanwhile, mosquitofish {THg} was negatively correlated with soil {TC}/{TN} molar ratio and positively correlated with soil {TC}/{TP} and {TN}/{TP} molar ratios, suggesting trophic truncation. Soil, surface water, and porewater {THg}, {TC}, and {OC} interactions resulted in significant differences between hotspot and non-hotspot stations and between molar ratios of C, N, and P. Periphyton-surface water {THg}/{OC} homeostasis and soil nutrient ratios significantly explained mosquitofish {THg} concentrations, further indicating a trophic influence on mosquitofish {THg} and potential hotspot dynamics. Several factors and processes including bottom-up trophic interaction and vegetation influence on Hg accumulation dynamics and food-chain length explain the development and persistence of Hg hotspot formation within the Everglades system.”, pages = “472”, number = “12”, journaltitle = “Water, Air, \&amp; Soil Pollution”, shortjournal = “Water Air Soil Pollut”, author = list(list(given = “Paul”, family = “Julian”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL), list(given = “Binhe”, family = “Gu”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL), list(given = c(“Alan”, “L.”), family = “Wright”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL)), date = “2016”, file = “11270_2016_3180_MOESM1_ESM.docx:C\:\\Julian_LaCie\\Zotero_new\\storage\\QBFLI8GE\\11270_2016_3180_MOESM1_ESM.docx:application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document;Full Text PDF:C\:\\Julian_LaCie\\Zotero_new\\storage\\H5YG9Q3L\\Julian et al.&nbsp;- 2016 - Mercury Stoichiometric Relationships in a Subtropi.pdf:application/pdf”), list(title = “Iron and Pyritization in Wetland Soils of the Florida Coastal Everglades”, volume = “40”, rights = “All rights reserved”, issn = “1559-2723, 1559-2731”, url = “http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12237-016-0180-3”, doi = “10.1007/s12237-016-0180-3”, pages = “822–831”, number = “3”, journaltitle = “Estuaries and Coasts”, author = list(list(given = “Paul”, family = “Julian”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL), list(given = “Randy”, family = “Chambers”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL), list(given = “Timothy”, family = “Russell”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL)), date = “2017”, file = “Julian et al_2017_Iron and Pyritization in Wetland Soils of the Florida Coastal Everglades.pdf:C\:\\Julian_LaCie\\Zotero_new\\storage\\SJZYFART\\Julian et al_2017_Iron and Pyritization in Wetland Soils of the Florida Coastal Everglades.pdf:application/pdf”), list(title = “Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem management in Everglades National Park”, volume = “25”, issn = “0923-4861, 1572-9834”, url = “http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11273-016-9509-8”, doi = “10.1007/s11273-016-9509-8”, pages = “191–209”, number = “2”, journaltitle = “Wetlands Ecology and Management”, author = list(list(given = “Paul”, family = “Julian”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL)), date = “2017”, file = “Julian_2017_Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem.pdf:C\:\\Julian_LaCie\\Zotero_new\\storage\\TDJJVV4R\\Julian_2017_Assessment of Upper Taylor Slough water quality and implications for ecosystem.pdf:application/pdf”), list(title = “Commentary on Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the Florida Everglades wetlands with wetlands: Can stormwater phosphorus be reduced to oligotrophic conditions?”, volume = “108”, issn = “09258574”, url = “http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0925857416303305”, shorttitle = “Commentary on “Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the Florida Everglades wetlands with wetlands”, pages = “333 – 337”, journaltitle = “Ecological Engineering”, author = list(list(given = “Paul”, family = “Julian”, role = NULL, email = NULL, comment = NULL)), date = “2016”, file = “Julian - 2016 - Commentary on “Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the.pdf:C\:\\Julian_LaCie\\Zotero_new\\storage\\6VT38DGY\\Julian - 2016 - Commentary on “Mitsch et al., 2015, Protecting the.pdf:application/pdf”), list(title = “Letter to the Editor regarding Surratt D, Shindle D, Yongshan W, et al.&nbsp;Letter to the Editor regarding: Julian P, 2017.

While the restoration effort is not complete and the ecosystem continues to experience short duration perturbations, a better understanding of long-term C dynamics of the Everglades is needed to facilitate new restoration efforts. This study evaluated temporal trends of different aquatic carbon (C) pools of the northern Everglades Protection Area over a 20-year period to gauge historic C cycling patterns. Dissolved inorganic C ({DIC}), dissolved organic C ({DOC}), particulate organic C ({POC}), and surface water carbon dioxide ({pCO}2(aq)) were investigated between May 1, 1994 and April 30, 2015.{ResultsAnnual} mean concentrations of {DIC}, {DOC}, {POC}, and {pCO}2(aq) significantly decreased through time or remained constant across the Water Conservation Areas ({WCAs}). Overall, the magnitude of the different C pools in the water column significantly differed between regions. Outgassing of {CO}2 was dynamic across the Everglades ranging from 420 to 2001 kg {CO}2 year-1. Overall, the historic trend in {CO}2 flux from the marsh declined across our study area while {pCO}2(aq) largely remained somewhat constant with the exception of Water Conservation Area 2 which experienced significant declines in {pCO}2(aq).

In this study, we evaluated the changes in the nutrient loading of the Kissimmee River floodplain during the restoration of the river–floodplain system. In addition to time-series loading analysis, we also evaluated soil nutrient concentrations across the lower portion of the Kissimmee River floodplain. During the 44-year nutrient loading time-series, the floodplain remained a nutrient exporter with changes in nutrient loading generally corresponding to both water quality (i.e., point source reductions) and hydrologic restoration activities in the watershed and Kissimmee River floodplain. During the study period, inputs of total phosphorus and total nitrogen loads from upstream either significantly increased or remained the same. In addition to external sources of nutrients, internal sources of nutrients from floodplain soils can also contribute to the total nutrient export from the system. These internal sources could be organic via the decomposition of organic matter or geologic from the original excavation of the canal and/or restoration backfilling. Soil nutrient concentrations vary between vegetative communities and landscape position and could be a significant source of phosphorus to the downstream system, which is plagued by eutrophic conditions.

Most P in inflow waters originates from urban, agricultural, and equestrian runoff, as well as discharges from Lake Okeechobee. To effectively reduce dissolved organic P ({DOP}) in the outflow of the {STAs}, {DOP} must be mineralized to soluble reactive phosphorus ({SRP}) (Ged and Boyer, 2013), and then removed through uptake by aquatic vegetation or co-precipitation with calcite during photosynthesis. In order to explore the effects of sunlight and photolytic processing on dissolved P mineralization within the {STAs}, a series of photochemical experiments were conducted. First, {DOM} entering the {STAs} was measured and found to be highly aromatic (mean {SUVA}&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.38) and dominated by large molecular weight molecules (75\% of bulk {DOM}&nbsp;{\textgreater}&nbsp;10KDa) that are reactive to photolytic degradation. Model molecules, such as phytic acid, and site water from the {STAs} were exposed to light and produced {SRP} from {DOP} after exposure to high energy {UV} radiation.

Climate change will likely alter river Si exports in biome-specific ways due to interacting shifts in chemical weathering rates, hydrologic connectivity, and metabolic processes in aquatic and terrestrial systems. Nonetheless, factors driving long-term changes in Si exports remain unexplored at local, regional, and global scales. We evaluated how concentrations and yields of dissolved Si ({DSi}) changed over the last several decades of rapid climate warming using long-term data sets from 60 rivers and streams spanning the globe (e.g., Antarctic, tropical, temperate, boreal, alpine, Arctic systems). We show that widespread changes in river {DSi} concentration and yield have occurred, with the most substantial shifts occurring in alpine and polar regions. The magnitude and direction of trends varied within and among biomes, were most strongly associated with differences in land cover, and were often independent of changes in river discharge. These findings indicate that there are likely diverse mechanisms driving change in river Si biogeochemistry that span the land-water interface, which may include glacial melt, changes in terrestrial vegetation, and river productivity. Finally, trends were often stronger in months outside of the growing season, particularly in temperate and boreal systems, demonstrating a potentially important role of shifting seasonality for the flux of Si from rivers.

Numerous regions have implemented beneficial management practices to combat agricultural nonpoint pollution, often evaluating efficacy at the field scale, but not downstream. In this study, we conducted an extensive, 11-year, all-season, weekly monitoring program in a small, shallow, hypereutrophic lake and main tributary located in a cold climate, northern temperate zone, within a predominantly agricultural-forested mesoscale watershed. The monitoring took place before and after the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures in the catchment, allowing assessment of changes over time in the downstream tributary and lake. We analyzed long-term trends and temporal change points for nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, aquatic trophic status, and nutrient stoichiometric ratios. The results revealed significant reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, improved lake trophic status from hypereutrophic to eutrophic, and an increase in total nitrogen: total phosphorus ratios following the implementation of field-scale agricultural nutrient mitigation measures. Notably, both the lake and its main tributary exhibited significant temporal change points for these parameters.

Understanding the drivers of seagrass distribution and extent in estuary systems is valuable for conservation and restoration efforts. A critical driver of seagrass distribution is how light moves through the water column (i.e.&nbsp;light attenuation) and the availability of light to reach the estuary bottom. Light attenuation combined with the depth of seagrass colonization is used to estimate the percent surface irradiance and is an indicator of seagrass light requirements The objective of this study was to evaluate optical water quality parameters within the Caloosahatchee River Estuary ({CRE}) relative to changes in freshwater discharge conditions. During the study period, freshwater discharge significantly increased resulting in an increase of annual stressful and damaging discharge events to marine seagrass species. Concurrent with changes in freshwater discharge conditions, changes to optical water quality parameters including color, chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and light attenuation were detected along the estuary. Using photo-interpreted seagrass coverage data combined with bathymetric data, the depth of colonization was estimated for three survey years (2008, 2014, and 2020). This information combined with a spatial and temporal light attenuation generalized additive model percent surface irradiance (\%{SI}) was estimated. Over the study period, \%{SI} significantly increased across the lower {CRE} indicating an improvement in light attenuation. The current freshwater management plan has increased stressful and damaging discharge events, however recent changes in operations has minimized these damaging events which could be linked to the precipitous increase in \%{SI} across the lower {CRE}. Seagrass density data collected from transects within the estuary suggest that prolonged stress and damaging ({\textgreater}5.13 hm3d-1) has significantly reduce species density.

Though this region is much like an island, home to high biodiversity and endemism, it is also the site of a century of development and associated landscape-scale species invasions. Melaleuca quinquenervia (hereafter melaleuca), a tree native to tropical Australia, was planted extensively throughout south Florida as street trees, levee stabilizers, and later to reduce standing water in marshy areas. Through extensive cooperation with the United States Department of Agriculture’s Australian Biological Control Laboratory, several biological control agents were released, three of which later successfully established. Herein we examine evidence that plant community shifts determined from vegetation surveys and remotely sensed images reflect changes from melaleuca-dominated wetlands (before management) to native communities (after management). Melaleuca-dominated community types decreased from 1990 to 2020 by more than 99\%. Vegetation surveys also reflect an increase in cypress wetlands, pinelands, and open water wetlands, all of which were dominated by melaleuca in previous decades. We also found the normalized difference vegetation index ({NDVI}) increased in melaleuca-invaded wetlands during peak infestations but decreased again after communities recovered to sawgrass-dominated wetlands. These responses are concomitant with the development of integrative management techniques for melaleuca that include mechanical, chemical, and biological control.
