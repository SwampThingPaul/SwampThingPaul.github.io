I am an ecologist with a multi-disciplinary background focused on aquatic biogeochemistry and ecology on the landscape scale. Generally, I can be classified as an aquatic biogeochemist studying biogoechemical processes along the freshwater to marine aquatic continuum. But wetlands hold a special place in my heart.  

A couple of word to describe me: Wetland Biogeochemistry, Ecologist, Data-scientist, Soil-Scientist, Naturalist, Swamp Walker, Lover of all things R

This website will host some general information about myself, my research interests and publications.
