# Welcome to the swamp. <img src="./static/SWE_logo_small.png" align="right" height="120"/>

I am an ecologist with a multi-disciplinary background focused on aquatic biogeochemistry and ecology on the landscape scale. Generally, I can be classified as an aquatic biogeochemist studying biogoechemical processes along the freshwater to marine aquatic continuum. I enjoy studying all aquatic ecosystems but wetlands hold a special place in my heart.   

**A couple of words/phrases to describe me:** Wetland Biogeochemist, Ecologist, Data-scientist, Soil-Scientist, Naturalist, Swamp Walker, Lover of all things R.

This website will host some general information about myself, my research interests and publications.

## Words of inspiration

_“My temple is the swamp …When I would recreate myself, I seek the darkest wood, the thickest and most impenetrable and to the citizen, most dismal, swamp. I enter a swamp as a sacred place, a sanctum sanctorum… I seemed to have reached a new world, so wild a place …far away from human society. What’s the need of visiting far-off mountains and bogs, if a half-hour’s walk will carry me into such wildness and novelty.”_

_“Whatever you want to do in this world, it is achievable. The most important thing that I’ve found, that perhaps you could use, is be passionate and enthusiastic in the direction that you choose in life, and you’ll be a winner.”_

_"...One thing you quickly sense about the people here: they include more than average proportion of idealists and self-motivated seekers. But they're all pretty down-to-earth. The work demands a lot of physical and mental effort. Slackers don't make it this far."_
